Big, or should we say small, news on the Polymer project - the size of the polymer.js file needed to run on fully-functional browsers is down to 32kb gzipped and minified.
 
By “fully functional browsers” we don’t just mean “Chrome.”  We’re building Polymer to be a framework for the web platform of tomorrow, not just the Chrome of today - as the great Wayne Gretzky would say, we’re skating to where the puck is going, not where it has been. As the web components standards are rolled into more and more browsers, the need for platform.js polyfills will shrink to 0 - and you’ll be left with just pure Polymer goodness.
 
Being future-facing and in Developer Preview means things today won’t always work as expected - your ongoing feedback and contributions are crucial to helping bridge the gap. And with only 32kb to download, the gap is smaller than ever.
