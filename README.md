Grunt tasks

Creating a post

Posts are in the `_posts` folder.  
When creating a new post, the titles should be in the form:  
`YYYY-MM-DD-title.markdown`
Drafts are in the `_drafts` folder.

Editing the blog
----------------
Main page layouts are in `_layouts`, with partials in `_includes`
Editable .scss files are in `_sass`, which are compiled into the `css` folder. These are automatically compiled when the site is compiled, with a jekyll plugin.
