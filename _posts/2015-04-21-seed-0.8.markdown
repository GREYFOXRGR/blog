excerpt: Create reusable Polymer 0.8 elements with our new version of `seed-element`. Features support for our latest version of web-component-tester and polyserve - a new way to serve up elements.

---

If you've written a [reusable Polymer element](https://www.polymer-project.org/0.5/docs/start/reusableelements.html) before, you may have tried out `<seed-element>` - our recommended starting point for new components. In line with refreshing Polymer for 0.8, we've just released a brand [new version](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/seed-element) of `<seed-element>` too. Roll on the :cake: emoji.

`<seed-element>` [0.1.7](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/seed-element) uses the new Polymer 0.8 syntax right out of the box, is well commented and also includes updated boilerplate for writing your own [unit tests](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/seed-element/blob/master/test/basic-test.html#L30) using the latest version of [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).

In addition, this new version includes support for our new Documentation viewer [`<iron-doc-viewer>`](https://github.com/polymerelements/iron-doc-viewer) and a new, convenient way of serving up your reusable elements called [Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve).

## Getting started

To get started with the new version of `<seed-element>`, follow these three steps:


* Create a new directory on your system for working on Polymer elements (e.g "development").
* Download the [seed-element](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/seed-element) boilerplate and unzip it in your working directory.
* Rename the element and its files accordingly. For example, if your element is called `<fancy-button>` and you’ve renamed the seed-element directory to fancy-button, your file list should look a little like this:


<pre>
├── README.md
├── bower.json
├── demo
│   └── index.html
├── fancy-button.html
├── index.html
└── test
    ├── basic-test.html
    └── index.html
</pre>

## Playing with your element

If you wish to work on your element in isolation, we recommend that you use
[Polyserve](https://github.com/PolymerLabs/polyserve) to keep your element's
bower dependencies in line. You can install it via:

    npm install -g polyserve

And you can run it via:

    polyserve

Once running, you can view your element's files under
`http://localhost:8080/components/seed-element/`, where `seed-element` is the
name of the directory containing it.

## Testing your element

Simply navigate to the `/test` directory of your element to run its tests. If
you are using Polyserve: `http://localhost:8080/components/seed-element/test/`

### web-component-tester

The tests are compatible with [web-component-tester](https://github.com/Polymer/web-component-tester).
Install it via:

    npm install -g web-component-tester

Then, you can run your tests on _all_ of your local browsers via:

    wct

## Support for Polymer 0.5

If you're creating reusable elements using Polymer 0.5.x, we recommend using seed-element 0.1.5, the last version of the boilerplate with support for older versions of Polymer.

## Wrapping up

Try out the new version of `<seed-element>`, let us know what you think and please feel free to file bugs if anything looks out of place. Rock on.
