excerpt: We've just tagged the 0.9.0-rc of the Polymer library, and will be releasing it as a proper 0.9 in about a week. Make sure to get ready for the change!

_We announce significant releases here on the blog, highlighting the major new features as well as breaking changes. As always, we'd love to get your feedback, issues, and PR's, so tweet us [@polymer](https://twitter.com/polymer) or contribute to the [Github](https://github.com/Polymer)._

The evolution of the Polymer library continues - we're nearing 0.9!

First, a bit about the 0.8 releases:

For the 0.8 version of the library, we've been keeping all of the 0.8 releases tagged as `0.8-rc*`. This has been explicitly to keep improperly specified `bower.json` from breaking suddenly - with an out-of-the-ordinary level of incompatibility from 0.5 to 0.8, along with not yet having the `paper` and `core` elements updated to the new formulation of the library, we didn't want to suddenly surprise everyone with a drastically breaking `bower update`.

Because of this, the 0.8 release was a bit of a "transitory" release - quickly iterating in the new API surface area while upgrading all of our elements.

Now that the 0.8 release has had some time to bake, and we've ported the majority of the [previous elements](https://github.com/polymerelements) to the new version, we're ready to rip off the band-aid and upgrade explicitly to a 0.9. The release candidate for 0.9 [has been tagged](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v0.9.0-rc.1), and we'll be tagging the official 0.9 release in a few days. In tandem with this, we'll also:

* Tag a 0.9-compatible release for all of the `paper` and `iron` elements in the [PolymerElements organization](https://github.com/polymerelements).
* Move the 0.9 version of the library to the `master` branch of Polymer/polymer.
* Update site documentation to refer to the 0.9 library.

In advance of this change *please make sure your bower.json is configured correctly to be ready for this change*. We recommend always pinning your `polymer` library requirement to a specific minor version: if you'd like to keep your `polymer` at 0.5.5 for the time being, set your `bower.json` as follows:

    dependencies: {
      "polymer": "Polymer/polymer#^0.5.5"
    }

Please do note that all of this upgrade weirdness is one-time-only - thank you for sticking with us through this "uncanny valley" as we transition the library towards a 1.0 release!
