## It's hackademic!

Over the past year, developer interest in Polymer and Web Components has exploded. We're thrilled to see this happen, and we want to try to find new ways to scale and bring the awesomness of these technologies to as many developers as possible. Starting in November, we've asked for Google Developer Groups from all around the world to host their own Polymer events, which we're calling ["Polytechnics"](http://itshackademic.com).

Generally, a Polytechnic will include a tech talk, self-guided code labs, and free time for hacking. We want attendees to come away feeling like they know the basics of working with Polymer, and excited to start experimenting with it in their own projects. All of the necessary materials to run your own Polytechnic (speaker deck, training video, code labs, graphic assets, etc) are available now at the official site: [itshackademic.com](http://itshackademic.com). 

Web Components are still a very new thing, so it's up to all of us, as a community, to grow this ecosystem, and help others get started. To find a Polytechnic near you, take a look at [the event map](http://itshackademic.com#events), where new events are being added every day. If you don't see an event in your area, [reach our to your local GDG lead](https://developers.google.com/groups/directory/ï»¿) to see if they can help you get one up and running. Also, be sure to spread the word with the **#itshackademic** hashtag!

Happy hacking, and we'll see you in November!
