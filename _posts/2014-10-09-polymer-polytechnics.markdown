## It's hackademic!

Over that past year, developer interest in Polymer and Web Components has exploded. We're thrilled to see this happen, and we want to try to find new ways to scale and bring the awesomness of these technologies to as many developers as possible. Starting in November, we've asked for Google Developer Groups from all around the world to host their own Polymer events, which we're calling ["Polytechnics"](http://itshackademic.com).

Generally, a Polytechnic will include a tech talk, self-guided codelabs, and free time for hacking. We want attendees to come away feeling like they know the basics of working with Polymer, and excited to start experimenting with it in their own projects.

Web Components are still a very new thing, so it's up to all of us, as a community, to grow this ecosystem, and help others get started. If you'd like to [find a Polytechnic near you](http://itshackademic.com/#events), check out the official site at [itshackademic.com](http://itshackademic.com), help spread the word with the **#itshackademic** hashtag, and we'll see you in November!
